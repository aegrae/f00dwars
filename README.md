f00dwars: THE FOOD IS INFECTED!!!!

As a part of the Recurse Center's first Springtime Game Jam, we built a game using Pico-8 !!!
Premise: the sky is falling, food is infected, and the laws of physics have run amok

The Game: avoid some food while eating others to switch your gravitational field's direction and thereby last for longer!
